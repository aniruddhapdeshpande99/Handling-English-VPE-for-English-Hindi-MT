False Negatives manually found:
    Still there? [Maybe - 'Be' verb type 'Are' is missing ]
    None on the first floor? [Maybe - 'Be' verb type 'Are'/'Aren't' is missing]
    This phone's owner? [Maybe - 'Who is' or some other fitting Verb Phrase perhaps missing. 
                        Question - How will only using head verb here suffice.]
    Here? [Same as above maybe - 'Is/are she/he/they Here?' or 'She/he's (or They're) here?']
    Hands in the air! - ['Place your hands in the air!' or 'Keep your hands in the air!' after resolution]
    To Bupyung station now! ['Come to Bupyung station now', based on exophoric resolution as the line before
                            this was 'Come out!']
    So I did that, right? [Exophoric Ellipsis. Ellipsis should have been detected at 'did' and the resolution for it
                          comes from the dialogue above this which says - 'To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.'
                          Here I also feel that resolving only the head verb 'show' will be less helpful than resolving the entire VP]
    If you can, raise it with her. [Here the resolution of the Ellipsis is after the Licensor and not before. This is ensured
                                   because of the comma after 'can'. The 'can' modal is still a licensor here for ellided head verb 'raise'.
                                   The sentence after resolution then would be "If you can raise, raise it with her."]


Correct Detection but no resolution (Exophoric):
    Uncle does, too.
    Yes, I did.
    Yes, you did. [This is the answer to the 'So I did that, right?' in the above section and the resolution
                  for this would be exophoric just like how it is above, but here the context goes back 2 dialogues
                  than 1 to the dialogue - 'To a girl like this, you need to show her who's the boss.'
                  Here I also feel that resolving only the head verb 'show' will be less helpful than resolving the entire VP]
    I will. [Here the Exophoric Resolution comes from the dialogue before this sentence. The previous dialogue says: 
            "Finish reading it." Here we also see a compound verb coming into play as well. The rules must also ensure that
            the correct head verb "Finish" is chosen here and not "reading" for resolution.]
Incorrect POS Tag marking:
    A thousand won left! ['left' is marked as adverb and not Verb]
